# Plants-shop
Website for an indoor and outdoor plants shop. 
Where you can choose your plant based on the following options: plant's place, its need for lighting, its size, how safe it is for pets, and the care level that it requires. The customers should register using an email and a password to be able to purchase plants and to have access to their previous purchases. 
After the customers add all the plants they need to the “shopping cart” they can view those items there, remove some plants from it, increase the number of some plants they wish to purchase or just checkout and pay the plants price.
